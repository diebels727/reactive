fixes/
* Abstract db
* Remove schema definition from application
* Generic logging with levels

improvements/
* add overwatch (this is definitely a service)
  - overwatch spawns N-workers to monitor reactive
  - reactive logs which channels each worker has joined
  - overwatch joins these channels
  - overwatch ensures that reactive is running on these channels.
  - if reactive is not running on these channels, then start reactive on these channels

* add registration (this is probably a service)
  - on join to a server, register nick
    - may require owning email server
  - when a nick is registered, log the nick/password in to a globally accessible database
  - these nicks are re-used
